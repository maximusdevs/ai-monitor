# Every released CHANGELOG section must still match the tag that shipped it,
# and the version files must never move backwards.
#
# Why this is a script and not a #[test]: it needs `git show <tag>`, and tests
# must not shell out to git. The AUR `check()` runs `cargo test` from an
# extracted tarball with no history, and packaging/nix/package.nix filters CHANGELOG.md
# out of the source set entirely — the in-tree guards already have to return
# Option and skip for that reason.
#
# The hazard it catches: a branch that predates the last tag carries its
# entries under [Unreleased], which is exactly where the newest released
# section now sits, so git merges the two together *cleanly*. It has happened
# five times in this repo, in three different shapes — silently inserted into a
# published section, conflicted into one, and deleting one outright — and every
# time the merge looked successful.
